This project was created as part of the maids.cc assessment for the front-end developer position. I initiated the project on Monday, 29th January, and successfully submitted it on Thursday, 1st February. I appreciate the opportunity you've given me!

PS: Please keep in mind that prior to this project, I had no knowledge of Angular. The state folder includes NgRx files, although I encountered challenges in implementing it. Despite that, I've kept it to showcase the logic I intended to incorporate.

Thank you for this valuable learning opportunity!
DON'T FORGET TO CHECK THE SCREENS WORD FILE!
